# XS1_HA
EZcontrolÂ® XS1 component for Home Assistant

# Work in progress
This component is in its baby shoes and in no way meant to be used in production.

# Configuration

Just add these two lines to your configuration:

    # XS1 Gateway
    xs1:
      host: "192.168.2.75"
      
The component will connect to the gateway and pick up all device configurations automatically.
If you change the configuration for a device on the XS1 gateway you currently have to restart home assistant to trigger an update.
